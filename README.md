# Public Key Infrastructure Example
An example of public key infrastructure with an offline root certificate authority on linux. A package of scripts to make setting up and maintaining an offline root certificate authority just a bit easier.

### _For HomeLab Experimentation Only_

### Machines Required
 - *ub16-ca-offline*: The offline root Certificate Authority (CA). Running Ubuntu 16.04
 - *ub16-ca*: The OCSP and CRL host for the offline root Certificate Authority (CA). Running Ubuntu 16.04 w/ LAMP stack
 - *ub16-ca-home*: The intermediate Certificate Authority (CA) for intranet. Running Ubuntu 16.04 w/ LAMP stack
 
## Installation

#### UB16-CA-OFFLINE SETUP
* Install Ubuntu (in our case 16)
* Remove wifi card. Unplug physical network cable. Disable CD/DVD and USB boot in BIOS. __Never restore this machine's connection to a network__
* From non privledged user directory: `git clone https://github.com/delphian/public-key-infrastructure-example.git`
* Enter repository `cd public-key-infrastructure-example`
* Switch to root `sudo su -`
* Execute `./root_ca_initialize.sh`
  * Create directory structure
  * Create root Certificate Authority (CA) private key and encrypt (ca.*DOMAIN*.key.pem file). __Do not echo the contents of this file to the terminal__. __Do not transfer over a computer network__.
    * Supply a PEM password for the root CA private key and save to a safe location. __Do not transfer over a computer network__. __Do not store on a network attached device__.
   * Create root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and self sign with private key (ca.*DOMAIN*.crt.pem file)
   * Create root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate revocation list (CRL) (revoked.crl file)
